# OMApp
How to build the app
1. open it in Xcode
2. select the schema "OstModernApp", and suggested device "iPhone 6s"
3. click "â–¶" to build the project and run the App.

Due to time constraints
1. code cleaning-up has not done yet
2. unit tests are not there (more time given, will do with TDD)
3. error handling not done yet
4. auto layout, may be issues on different devices

I can explain all of them if I got a chance.
